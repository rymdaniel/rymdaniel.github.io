            <h2 class="title">Foreword: An Apology to M</h2>
            <h3>Apr. 27, 2016</h3>
            <p>M,<br><br>&emsp;You left. The reasons why were obvious: me. Specifically my ignorance and incapacity to get involved in our relationship. Things just weren&#39;t going anywhere, yet you tried. You tried to salvage what was so beautiful about the first times we got to know each other. What could&#39;ve been years of incredible memories turned to weeks of dry and dead interactions.<br><br>&emsp;Self-loathing and self-pity were things I carried with me long before I met you. I don&#39;t know why I wasn&#39;t able to change my perspective on life once we had met. Fear most likely. Everything was so new. What I had found in you was so different compared to everyone and everything else. I knew very well that we were something I had to hold onto for as long as I could. <br><br>&emsp;Plans for a brighter future were canceled and are now long gone. Yet I, like a stubborn child, still hold on. When will it end? When do I let go? I shouldâ€™ve long ago but something within me is afraid of erasing everything and starting over. There are just so many things I look back on and realize I had no clue as to what I was doing. I can only hope you&#39;ve let go and moved on. God forbid my negligence still haunts you. I wouldn&#39;t be able to forgive myself if I were to find out you still want more, despite all my mistakes. I wish this were all a dream. You can wake up and move on from those.
                <br><br>Yours,
                <br><br>D

                <h2 class="title">Outcast</h2>
            <p>Without a place of belonging. An outcast in the universe. A nuisance to God himself.<br><br>I realized I hadn&#39;t been true to myself. I had been telling God to keep me here for some reason but I did not know what for. Why did I insist? <br><br>&#34;Stop!&#34; I said.<br><br>I vanished.<br><br>Here I am and there I was. Existing without need and wanting more than needed. I had no ambition or sense of direction. My self-identity was a shattered one pulling in different directions. Who am I anyways? A joke amongst my peers. A joke to my family. A joke to the world. I was nothing more than dirt. I had willed it all this way.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve come to realize I am addicted to feeling melancholic / empty / depressed. I can&#39;t seem to let go of this dark side of myself. It is who I am, and getting rid of it by force would render me fake/someone I am not. </p><br>

            <h3>July 24<sup>th</sup> &#91;11:50am&#93;</h3>
            <p>Apparently I&#39;m also the proud owner of a martyr complex.</p>
            <h3>August 6<sup>th</sup> &#91;4:58am&#93;</h3>
            <p>The intervals between each entry has really sky rocketed without warning. Needless to say the cause is the internet and all the distraction it brings. At least there are things I can fall back on to keep me distracted and numb from the daily jargon. I do, though, need to spend more time on other things as best I can. All I do now is stare at the abyss, and it stares back at me. All I hear is the screeching sound of silence that surrounds my head. I want to pull the hair from my scalp and release jets of unfiltered emotions like anger, fear, and sadness. I want to punch something. I&#39;ve been forgetting to write down my dreams out of laziness. Why am I so lazy and pessimistic about everything? Sometimes, though I do like this feeling, I can&#39;t help but feel the need to escape! It frightens me; the thought of living with this personality forever. I try to start anew and always give up after a little while. I lie to myself, saying â€œYou&#39;re doing good! At least you tried! And I know that&#39;s not good enough, but I cave in anyways and forget my goals and ambitions all in exchange for immediate gratification and to get drugged by that which is the internet. I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing I feel nothing...</p>
            <h3>Sept. 25<sup>th</sup> &#91;8:10pm&#93;</h3>
            <p>Her voice and laugh are like rivers of honey and it feels like strawberry vanilla ice cream flowing through my head. It sends chills throughout my body but I also feel like when the morning&#39;s first sun rays hit your body. I feel a surge of electricity, my fingers feel numb, my eyes feel kike I&#39;m staring at the rainbow along with every other unseeable color and ray.</p>
            <h3>Oct. 9<sup>th</sup> &#91;9:26pm&#93;</h3>
            <p>Yesterday was amazing for once! One of the best conversations I&#39;ve had. The person I was talking to said, "We should&#39;ve recorded this!" Now the words are gone like the flicker of floating ash from the crackle of burning flame.</p>
            <h3>Oct. 15<sup>th</sup> &#91;9:29pm&#93;</h3>
            <p>I can become the actor...&emsp;I can become the performance. I can change my face depending on the situation and the factors pertaining to it. Give me a person and I&#39;ll try my best to be. Play the part. I can do that. Get me drunk and I&#39;d probably scare myself as to what I could do. I feel restless to try to see all the personas I can act out that are stored inside this mind. Be more open! Be more open! Be more open! Be more open! Be more open! Be more open! Be more open! </p>
            <h3>Dec. 10<sup>th</sup>&#91;9:42pm&#93;</h3>
            <p>The clouds turn amber from the radiant city lights. It&#39;s more disgusting than lovely. It&#39;d be nice if the clouds along with everything else were more natural. Artificial landscapes unending; the natural set aside. What happened to reality? It&#39;s been distorted.</p>
            <h3>Unknown Date &#91;Unknown Time&#93;</h3>
            <p>Happiness - what is it to me? Happiness is nothing more than another rare emotion that I consider more of a benign plague. I only experience it in small bursts and only when I waste my time on the internet; the ultimate opiate I&#39;ve found can assist the boredom from day to day. It&#39;s an unfortunate realization that I&#39;ve become the very thing I hoped I would stray away from; a motionless and emotionless zombie finding peace only in solace and ridicule of the normal and banal.<br><br>Split into two the outcomes of my actions bring two possible paths at my feet. I&#39;m hesitant towards both. I&#39;ve been in this situation before. I know the outcome. I have false hope that fuels my curiosity - I should quit this. I know very well who I am or rather who I am not and what I can&#39;t do. These situations seem to stick with me. If it isn&#39;t one problem it&#39;s another. To hell with this road, the failures, and the fear limiting my decision making, but most of all I curse my mind for thinking this way.</p>
            <h3>Unknown Date &#91;Unknown Time&#93;</h3>
            <p>There are special times when I wish that every single wrong I have done, every negative word I have spoken, would once and for all all come and slap me in the face with a vengeance so grand that I knew not what to make of myself.<br><br>I&#39;ve done many things I am not happy about and there are as well many things I haven&#39;t done which make me unhappy as well. ALl I want is for all my punishments to come at once... every single one, because this may be the only way I will learn to be fully selfless and fully aware of those around me.<br><br>I wish I could help, but I haven&#39;t learned my lesson. How can I teach the world?</p>
            <h3>Unknown Date &#91;Unknown Time&#93;</h3>
            <p>I hear the words escape your mouth. You speak with conviction with the hopes to mar the callous skin I&#39;ve told you one too many times is impenetrable.<br><br>Yet you, knowing and understanding what and who I am see past that simple lie and talk regardless and break each layer one by one even after your departure.<br><br>Your words and your spirit linger on in though and even then have the strength as if you were present to destroy every single hope and dream I once had of overcoming what was once ours.<br><br>You tear from within like a parasite one never notices until too late.<br><br>But you eat away at me with such care - almost as if to lead me in the direction I must go for my own good rather than lead me to my own demise.<br><br>You did all this with good intent and yet I was too stupid to realize your best efforts to calm the storm I though was raining down upon us. There was never anything wrong between our beliefs and morals - rather I was the one at fault for everything that came to be. My own actions brought upon our destruction and more so my own. For this I am sorry and may never say it directly towards you, but through written word I can say it all.<br><br>I fall the to the floor face first and crawl to the door as I seek to escape. It&#39;s as if your name has been branded straight into my skull and brain because every time I look in the mirror I remember the face I shared with the world when I was much happier for being with you.<br><br>How I want to scrape away and grate every last fiber bearing your mark but to do so would destroy a part of me in the process. For this reason I control my impulse and cause myself to suffer indefinitely. To suffer because it feels good. To suffer because I like it.</p>
            <h3>Oct. 29 &#91;7:10pm&#93;</h3>
            <p>There&#39;s lots of work to be done. There must be full substitution of all impulsive behaviors with things that will benefit others and myself. We shall no longer be slaves to impulse to the degree we once were. It is with firm belief that by creating an axiom by which to live by then the self will adjust and fall into place. That being the case these rules must be designed with supreme care so as to assure maximum potential and also some flexibility for change.</p>
