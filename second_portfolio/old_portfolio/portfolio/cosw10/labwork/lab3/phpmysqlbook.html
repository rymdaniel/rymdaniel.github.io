		<p>Section 1 is a quick-start course that shows how to use the latest versions of PHP, MySQL, the Apache web server, and the NetBeans IDE to build your first PHP applications. And right from the start, you'll learn to create applications that conform to the MVC pattern, so they'll be easier to maintain as they grow.</p>
		<p>Then, Section 2 takes you deep into PHP by covering the skills you'll use every day in professional applications, like how to work with form data, dates, arrays, sessions, cookies, functions, objects, regular expressions, and exceptions. Likewise, Section 3 dives into MySQL, teaching you how to design and create a database, as well as how to access and maintain the data in a database like the professionals do. Finally, Section 4 teaches you important web programming skills like how to secure web pages, prevent SQL injection attacks, guard against XSS attacks, send email, upload files, process images, and access content from other websites.</p>
