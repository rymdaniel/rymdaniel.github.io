        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Hello. My name is Daniel Palacios</p>
        <p>I'm a graduate of Otis College of Art and Design located off the 405 next to LAX. I received a B.F.A with a focus in Photography though my work varies across different mediums. Towards the end of my years there I found a refuge in writing and began to combine it with video, performance, and installation.</p>
        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <p>I'm still trying to decide between Computer Science and Web Development. Given my previous creative endeavours I really like the idea of both developing and designing websites. I'm also extremely analytical and love probelm solving so that's where I also find myself leaning towards Computer Science. Hopefully the classes I'm taking this year will help me decide which route to go.</p>
