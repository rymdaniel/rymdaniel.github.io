            <p>&emsp;Berlin had a rough entry into the 21st century. In 2001 the city finally plunged into the deep financial crisis that had been looming for years. Accused of mismanagement, excessive spending and corruption during his 15-year period in office, mayor Eberhard Diepgen of the centre-right CDU (Christian Democratic Union) was forced to resign. Klaus Wowereit, representing the centre-left SPD (Social Democrat Party), became his successor after the 2001 elections, and formed an unprecedented governing coalition with the postcommunist PDS (Party of Democratic Socialism, recently renamed Linkspartei or Left Party).</p><br>

            &emsp;Even after five years in office, however, the so-called 'Red-Red Coalition' has not yet been able to improve Berlin's balance sheet. Painful, across-the-board spending cuts, federal subsidies and other measures have so far done little or nothing to kick-start the city's economic engine or bring down the unemployment rate. Some economic branches are blooming, though, such as fashion, design and tourism. It helps, but just not enough.<br><br>
            &emsp;Multiculturalism and the integration of immigrants have been other hot topics around dinner tables in recent years. In early 2005, a wave of 'honour killings' of young Muslim women wishing to live a western lifestyle, shocked not only Berliners but the world as well. Schools in Kreuzberg where every single student is of Turkish descent have raised the spectre of Parallelgesellschaften (parallel societies) and challenged Berliners' legendary tolerance.</p><br>

            <p>&emsp;But the news isn't all dire. Berlin continues to take shape, with the opening of the Holocaust Memorial, the Akademie der Künste (Academy of Arts) and the Hauptbahnhof (Main Train Station) being just three of the most high- profile recent additions. And in 2006, the entire city was awash with World Cup fever, with Berliners ready to welcome the global community in with open arms and hearts, to put aside their worries for a month and do what they do best…party!
