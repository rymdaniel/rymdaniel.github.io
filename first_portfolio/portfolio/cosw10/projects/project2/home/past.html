            <p>&emsp;The German people has become strong again in spirit, strong in will, strong in endurance, strong to bear all sacrifices.<br><br>
            &emsp;The German people are not a warlike nation. It is a soldierly one, which means it does not want a war, but does not fear it. It loves peace but also loves its honor and freedom.<br><br>
            &emsp;National Socialist Germany wants peace because of its fundamental convictions. And it wants peace also owing to the realization of the simple primitive fact that no war would be likely essentially to alter the distress in Europe... The principal effect of every war is to destroy the flower of the nation... Germany needs peace and desires peace!<br><br>
            &emsp;The seed has been sown that will grow one day . . . to the glorious rebirth of the National Socialist movement of a truly united nation.
            &emsp;Germany will either be a world power or will not be at all.<br><br>
